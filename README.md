# java-hello
first java repo


[My second homework assignment](https://github.com/ShadowDragonGem/java-hello/tree/collectionsHomework/src/collectionHomework)

[The rest of my assignments and practices will be in my new repositiory because the local version i have of this repository stopped running anything at all.](https://github.com/ShadowDragonGem/java-classAssignments)

Any further links will be seen on the main page of that repository, and this will be the only additional repository I am going to make for something like this.  I'll be switching completely to that repository for class assignments and practices.
